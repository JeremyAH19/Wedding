        <p class="section-content">Carolyn and Jeremy met in December 2015. Carolyn managed to make a stellar impression by arriving an hour late to their first date. However, she still won Jeremy over and he was asking for a second date before the evening ended. They immediately bonded over their love of dogs, being in NYC and travel. </p>
        <p class="section-content">Now living on the Upper East Side, they continue to explore their favorite city by visiting museums, trying new restaurants (all the sushi!), seeing Broadway shows and walking around aimlessly with Metro. Metro is an energetic and funny-looking chihuahua mix who they adopted together from the ASPCA late last year. He now joins them on their adventures and is very proficient at taking the NYC subway.</p>
        <p class="section-content">Jeremy popped the question on February 5th, 2018 while they were *attempting to* cook dinner together. Acknowledging the excitement by running around in countless circles, Metro couldn't be happier that his human parents are getting married. They celebrated their engagement a few weeks later with a trip to Spain and can't wait to continue celebrating with all their family and friends!</p>
